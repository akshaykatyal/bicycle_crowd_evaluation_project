## Bicycle crowd evaluation ##

## Bicycle Crowd evaluation Project. This is for the evaluation of the new crowd in the automotive dataset given at (https://www.a2d2.audi). ##

For the tasks there are 4 main task + presentation. 

Now to make it easy have created 4 folders for each of the task. 

Now the task1 is the folder for Task-1. This task has 4 sub parts.
* Task1a: 
    - list the annotators for the bicycle dataset. Just run the file with command  `python Task1a.py` to see the output. 
    
* Task1b: 
    - This is to get the annotations durations that is min, max duration times. Just run the file with command  `python Task1b.py` to see the output. 
      
* Task1c: 
    - This is to get the difference between the annotations result. Just run the file with command  `python Task1c.py` to see the output. 
    
* Task1d: 
    - This is to give the annotators that disaggree the most. Just run the file with command  `python Task1d.py` to see the output
    
Now the task2 is the folder for Task-2. 

* Task2: 
   - This task is to analyze the annotations with label corrupt and can't solve. Just run the file with command  `python task2.py` to see the output

Now the task3 is the folder for Task-3. 

* Task3: 
   - This task is to analyze whether the reference set is balanced or not. Just run the file with command  `python task3.py` to see the output.
  
Now the task4 is the folder for Task-4. 
* Task4: 
   - This task is to analyze good and bad annotators for the given dataset. All plots are given. Just run the file with command  `python task4.py` to see the output.
  

Now task 5 is presentation. This is there in the presentation folder. This gives the summary of the findings.
